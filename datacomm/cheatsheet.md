---

#### **IPv4 Protocol**

- **Purpose**: The main protocol for packetizing, forwarding, and delivering data at the network layer.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Unreliable**: Provides a best-effort delivery service.
  - **Connectionless**: Datagrams are treated independently; they may take different routes and arrive out of order.
  - **Dependency**: Requires reliable transport protocols (e.g., **TCP**) for reliability.

---

#### **IPv4 Datagram Format**

- **Header** (20-60 bytes): Contains routing and delivery information.

  - **Fields**:
    - **Version (VER)**: Identifies the IP version.
    - **Header Length (HLEN)**: Number of 4-byte words in the header.
    - **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Limits the number of hops a packet can take.
    - **Checksum**: Validates the header.
  - **Payload**: Contains data from upper-layer protocols.

- **Best-Effort Delivery**:
  - No guarantees for packet delivery, order, or integrity.
  - Relies on higher layers for error correction.

---

#### **Datagrams and Fragmentation**

- **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**:

  - The maximum payload a link-layer frame can carry.
  - **Fragmentation**:
    - Divides datagrams into smaller fragments if they exceed the MTU.
    - Each fragment has its own header.
    - Reassembly occurs only at the destination.

- **Fragmentation Fields**:
  - **Identification**: Identifies fragments of the same datagram.
  - **Flags**:
    - **More Fragments (MF)**: Indicates if more fragments follow.
  - **Fragment Offset**: Position of a fragment within the original datagram.

---

### **ICMP Protocol (IPv4)**

---

#### **IPv6 Address Types**

1. **Unicast**:
   - Identifies a single interface.
2. **Anycast**:
   - Delivered to the nearest device in a group.
3. **Multicast**:
   - Delivered to multiple devices in a group.

---

#### **IPv6 Transition Strategies**

1. **Dual Stack**:
   - Devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 until IPv4 is phased out.
2. **Tunneling**:
   - IPv6 packets are encapsulated within IPv4 packets in IPv4 regions.

2. Understand **distance-vector** and **link-state routing algorithms**.
3. Explain intra-domain routing protocols: **RIP** and **OSPF**.
4. Describe transport-layer services.
5. Explain how **UDP** works and its characteristics.

---

### **Key Concepts**

---

#### **Unicast Routing**

- **Definition**: Routing a datagram destined for **one** destination (one-to-one delivery).
- **Routing Protocols**: Ensure routers have a **forwarding table** to determine the next hop toward the destination.
- **Forwarding Table**: Built and updated dynamically using routing protocols.

---

#### **Routing Algorithms**

1. **Distance-Vector (DV) Routing Algorithm**:

   - **Decentralized**: Each router maintains a **distance vector** (an array with the cost to reach each destination).
   - Updates based on the **Bellman-Ford equation**:
     > \( D*{xy} = \min \{ D*{xy}, (c*{xz} + D*{zy}) \} \)
     - \( D\_{xy} \): Shortest distance from \( x \) to \( y \).
     - \( c\_{xz} \): Cost of the link between \( x \) and \( z \).
     - \( D\_{zy} \): Distance from \( z \) to \( y \).
   - Routers exchange vectors with neighbors to update routes.

2. **Link-State (LS) Routing Algorithm**:
   - **Centralized**: Routers compute the least-cost paths using **global network knowledge**.
   - Steps:
     1. Each router gathers information about **link costs** via **flooding** (sending Link-State Packets, LSPs).
     2. Routers build a **Link-State Database** (LSDB).
     3. Use **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to calculate least-cost trees.
   - **Advantages**: Faster convergence, better handling of large networks.

---

### **Intra-Domain Routing Protocols**

1. **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**:

   - Based on **distance-vector routing**.
   - Cost metric: **Number of hops**.
   - Maximum hop count: **15** (16 is infinity).
   - Updates exchanged periodically or when changes occur.

2. **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**:
   - Based on **link-state routing**.
   - Routers broadcast routing information across the AS.
   - Flexible cost metric: Based on **throughput**, **reliability**, etc.
   - Supports **hierarchical routing** with **areas** to reduce traffic in large ASs.

---

### **Transport Layer**

- Responsible for **process-to-process communication**.
- Services provided:
  1. **Addressing**: Uses **port numbers** to identify processes.
  2. **Encapsulation/Decapsulation**: Wraps and unwraps data from the application layer.
  3. **Multiplexing/Demultiplexing**: Manages multiple communication streams.
  4. **Flow Control**: Prevents sender from overwhelming the receiver.
  5. **Error Control**: Detects and retransmits lost/corrupted data.

# Week 12: **Understanding TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

---

### **Learning Outcomes**

1. Explain how **TCP** works.
2. Describe the characteristics and mechanisms of **TCP**.

---

### **Key Concepts**

---

#### **TCP Overview**

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**:
  - Connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, in-order, error-free data delivery.
  - Full-duplex communication: Data flows in both directions simultaneously.
  - Logical connection: Established via **three-way handshake** and terminated gracefully using **four-way handshake**.
  - Supports **flow control**, **error control**, and **congestion control**.

---

#### **TCP Characteristics**

1. **Stream-Oriented Protocol**:

   - Data is transmitted as a **stream of bytes**, not discrete messages.
   - Sender and receiver maintain buffers to manage data flow.

2. **Numbering System**:

   - Each byte in the stream is assigned a unique **sequence number**.
   - Two key header fields:
     - **Sequence Number**: Identifies the first byte in a segment.
     - **Acknowledgement Number**: Indicates the next expected byte from the sender.

3. **Segment Format**:
   - Contains a **mandatory header** and optional fields.
   - Important fields:
     - **Checksum**: Ensures data integrity.
     - **Window Size**: Determines flow control.
     - **Control Flags**: Manage connection setup, teardown, and data transfer.

---

#### **TCP Connection Management**

1. **Connection Establishment**: **Three-Way Handshake**

   - Ensures both sender and receiver are ready for communication.
   - Exchange of **SYN** (synchronize) and **ACK** (acknowledge) flags.

   ![Three-Way Handshake](./img/tcp_connection.png)

2. **Connection Termination**:

   - **Four-Way Handshake**:
     - Initiated by either client or server.
     - Exchange of **FIN** (finish) and **ACK** flags.
   - **Half-Close**:
     - One side can stop sending data while still receiving from the other.

   ![Connection Termination](./img/tcp_termination.png)

---

#### **TCP Flow Control**

- Ensures the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver's buffer.
- Managed using the **Receive Window (rwnd)**:
  - Advertised by the receiver to inform the sender of available buffer space.
  - Sender limits unacknowledged data to the **rwnd** value.

---

#### **TCP Error Control**

1. **Acknowledgements**:

   - Confirms receipt of data.
   - Cumulative: Acknowledges all bytes up to the missing byte.

2. **Sequence Numbers**:

   - Detects **lost**, **duplicate**, or **out-of-order** segments.
   - Helps reassemble data at the receiver.

3. **Retransmissions**:

   - Two types:
     - **After Timeout**: Resends if no ACK is received within a timeout interval.
     - **Fast Retransmission**: Triggered by three duplicate ACKs, indicating a likely loss.

4. **Checksum**:
   - Verifies data integrity using a 16-bit checksum.

---

#### **TCP Congestion Control**

- Prevents overwhelming the network.
- Adjusts the sending rate based on network feedback.
- Key mechanism: **Congestion Window (cwnd)**:
  - Limits the number of unacknowledged bytes in the network.
  - Adjusted dynamically based on perceived congestion.

1. **Congestion Control Phases**:

   - **Slow Start**:
     - cwnd starts at 1 MSS and doubles each round-trip time (RTT) until it reaches a threshold (**ssthresh**).
   - **Congestion Avoidance**:
     - cwnd increases linearly after reaching **ssthresh**.
   - **Fast Recovery**:
     - Triggered by three duplicate ACKs.
     - cwnd is reduced but allows for quicker recovery.

2. **Congestion Detection**:
   - **Timeout**: Indicates severe congestion; cwnd is reset to 1 MSS.
   - **Duplicate ACKs**: Indicates mild congestion; cwnd is halved.

---

#### **TCP vs. UDP**

| Feature                | **TCP**                        | **UDP**                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Connection**         | Connection-oriented            | Connectionless         |
| **Reliability**        | Reliable (error-free delivery) | Unreliable             |
| **Flow Control**       | Yes                            | No                     |
| **Congestion Control** | Yes                            | No                     |
| **Error Detection**    | Checksum + retransmission      | Optional checksum      |
| **Speed**              | Slower (due to overhead)       | Faster (low overhead)  |
| **Use Case**           | Reliable file transfer         | Real-time applications |

---

#### **Summary**

- TCP is a **reliable, connection-oriented protocol** offering error-free, in-order delivery of data.
- Key mechanisms:
  - **Connection management**: Three-way handshake for setup; four-way handshake for teardown.
  - **Flow control**: Uses the receiver's advertised **rwnd** to prevent buffer overflow.
  - **Error control**: Acknowledgements, sequence numbers, and retransmissions ensure data integrity.
  - **Congestion control**: Manages network traffic using **cwnd** and phases like **slow start**.
- TCP is ideal for applications requiring reliable communication, such as file transfers and email.
